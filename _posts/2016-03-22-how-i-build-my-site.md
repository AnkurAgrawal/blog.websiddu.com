excerpt: 'Few months ago, my old website was pretty static and whenever I want to add a new project to my portfolio, I have to goto the file add the required details build the project again and FTP it to server. Which is a little tedious task if I want to do this even if I  misspelt some thing in the content.'

Everything starts with a <code>Hello World</code> so does this blog.

For the first time everything will be under heavy development, until I get it the way I want.

As I really enjoy making stuff, I decided to try to make small JavaScript or CSS (SASS) plugin/script every week.
Those are going to be both big and small, proof of concepts and production ready stuff.
