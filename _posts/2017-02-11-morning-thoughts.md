Here are the list of morning thoughts I had from the past few weeks, some might sound stupid but they are really deep you just have to think which we general do less these days.

> Ur enemy will be ur friend in deep forest when you both r alone. Enmity is situational. Don't make enemies. Make friends.

> You cannot unring a bell. Be careful with what you speak.

> Past is like your ex & future is like a super model, they never come to you. Forget past & future.. focus on present.

> Doing the wrong thing can be the right thing sometimes. Use your common sense.

> Good is not always good. Bad is not always bad. It's just a perspective. Don't judge.

> Life is not a race. Don't compete, live it.

> There is no definition of success. Don't just try to be successful, be full in every aspect

> Women are like nature. Both are beautiful/lifegivers. Never disrespect them, they will be a catastrophe & you can't survive.

> Always being happy is like a soap bubble.U never know when it pops.Don't float like bubble,roll like a 🎳 ball on the ground.

> Life is not short. On avg its freaking 70 years. Take it slow. Don't be stupid, be thoughtful.

> People and relations are more valuable than your expensive handbag/car. Don't be materialistic, be humanistic.

> Comparing self with others is cause for dissatisfaction. Don't compare, be unique.

> Hardwork & pain are like caterpillars 🐛  they are temp the end result success is a butterfly 🦋. You just have to be patient.

> Life sucks in general. Make it less sucky by being happy with whatever you got.

> Design feedback is for your designs not for you. Take it to the mind not to the heart.

> Don't go behind people who you love. Prioritize people who loves you.

> Hate is the cause for unhappiness. Don't hate be neutral.

> Social pressure is the biggest reason for unhappiness.
