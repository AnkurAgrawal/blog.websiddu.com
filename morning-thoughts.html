                <p>Here are the list of morning thoughts I had from the past few weeks, some might sound stupid but they are really deep you just have to think which we general do less these days.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certainty will make your life lazy and boring. Be uncertain and expect the unexpected to make your life more lively.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before you think about the things that you don‚Äôt have, think about the things you have and appreciate them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forgiveness is like climbing to the top of a steep mountain. It‚Äôs hard, but once you reach there you are on the TOP.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emotions are like sudden waves in an ocean journey. They will take u in a wrong direction, if you don‚Äôt navigate properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trust is a mysterious concept like a kids brain. None knows how it works or why it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beliefs are generally your wishes that you think would happen. All wishes won‚Äôt happen, similarly not all beliefs are true.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Listen to everyone, but at the end do whatever you like. After all you are responsible for your own actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge that is not shared with the right audiences is like a rain in the middle of an ocean. It‚Äôs kind of useless.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seeking attention from other people is like seeking attention from a cat. They don‚Äôt give af. Don‚Äôt keep expectations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fire will be seen even in the dark. Truth prevails over lies and falsehood  eventually.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every action there is an equal and  opposite reaction. Which is also called karma. Do good to get good.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dog should control its tail.. not the other way. Make sure only you control your life and not anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>U don‚Äôt have the right to choose ur birth, parents, color or death. But u have all rights to choose ur life. Make it count.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You r lucky to have that one person who loves u &amp; stays with u forever without any blood relation. Love &amp; don‚Äôt loose them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ur enemy will be ur friend in deep forest when you both r alone. Enmity is situational. Don‚Äôt make enemies. Make friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot unring a bell. Be careful with what you speak.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Past is like your ex &amp; future is like a super model, they never come to you. Forget past &amp; future.. focus on present.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doing the wrong thing can be the right thing sometimes. Use your common sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good is not always good. Bad is not always bad. It‚Äôs just a perspective. Don‚Äôt judge.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is not a race. Don‚Äôt compete, live it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no definition of success. Don‚Äôt just try to be successful, be full in every aspect</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Women are like nature. Both are beautiful/lifegivers. Never disrespect them, they will be a catastrophe &amp; you can‚Äôt survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always being happy is like a soap bubble.U never know when it pops.Don‚Äôt float like bubble,roll like a üé≥ ball on the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is not short. On avg its freaking 70 years. Take it slow. Don‚Äôt be stupid, be thoughtful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>People and relations are more valuable than your expensive handbag/car. Don‚Äôt be materialistic, be humanistic.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comparing self with others is cause for dissatisfaction. Don‚Äôt compare, be unique.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hardwork &amp; pain are like caterpillars üêõ  they are temp the end result success is a butterfly ü¶ã. You just have to be patient.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
